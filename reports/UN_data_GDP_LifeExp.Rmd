This is a report and it was prepared for this workshop I'm in. Very important work. 
GDP is 100% absolutely correlated to life expectancy and this report will show that.
Dare I say it is evidence of causation!

```{r}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("un-report/data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```
```{r gdp_lifeExp_1997_plot}
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop/1e6) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x= "GDP per cap", y = "Life Expectancy", title = "Do wealthy people live longer?",
       size = "Population (in millions)")
```
